## Package structure and operating method

This vignette provides an overview of how the package is structures and how the
functions are used. It is intended for package developers and contributors.

### Runtime endpoints

The runtime works by querying HTTP endpoints configured by AWS Lambda.
These endpoints are determined by on the "AWS_LAMBDA_RUNTIME_API" environment
variable set by AWS Lambda during initialisation. They generally won't be
available locally.

* The **next invocation endpoint** is the endpoint which R must query for
  the next input. R must send a `GET` request to this endpoint and will wait
  until either a response is received or the Lambda instance is shut down for
  inactivity. When AWS Lambda receives an input from, say, an API Gateway, it
  will respond to R's request with details of the input. We call the response to
  this request an _invocation_ in this document, and invocations are interpreted
  as _events_.
* The **initialisation error endpoint** is where an error should be sent if
  the error occurs when setting up the runtime. This is distinct from errors 
  that occur during handling of an event.
* The **response endpoint** is where an event response should be sent. It is
  unique for each event.
* The **invocation error endpoint** is where errors that occur during event
  handling should be reported. It is unique for each event.

The next invocation and initialisation error endpoints are unique in each Lambda 
instance. The response and invocation error endpoints are determined by the
`request_id` associated with each invocation. The request ID is given in the
"lambda-runtime-aws-request-id" header in the response to the query to the
next invocation endpoint.

### Handler functions

Every Lambda instance is centred around a single function which handles any
inputs. The _handler function_ is determined by an environment variable which
can be configured in one of two ways:

* as the `CMD` to the Dockerfile which contains the runtime, or
* as configured through the Lambda console (this takes precedence)

The `lambda_config` function (run as part of `start_lambda`) picks up on this
environment variable and identifies the R function to which it refers. This
handler function is used to process all invocations.

### Event classification according to invocation

Events need to be handled differently depending upon whether they are invoked
directly, by an API Gateway, etc. Events are classified according to their
detected invocation method, with their invocation stored as an S3 class. The
following functions dispatch on this class:

* `parse_event_content` converts the raw event content into arguments to be
  passed to the handler function
* `seralise_result` converts the result into the form that will be sent back to
  Lambda
* `extract_context` extracts metadata about the event as a list. If the handler
  function accepts a named `context` argument then it will receive the context
  as a value to that argument.
* `handle_event_error` deals with errors that occur during event handling. Some 
  invocation types require errors to be formatted or handled in a very specific
  way.

### Event listening lifecycle

The main function --- `start_lambda` --- accepts an optional configuration
provided by `lambda_config`. The default configuration should suffice if the
handler is configured in either the Dockerfile or the _AWS Lambda_ console. It
will then run the internal `start_listening` function.

The `start_listening` function will augment the configuration with context
extracted from the environment (using the `extract_context_from_environment`
function). It will then set up an infinite loop that listens for _invocations_, interprets them as _events_, and processes them with the handler function. 

Specifically, `start_listening` triggers the listening loop, which consists of
`wait_for_event` and `handle_event` (combined into `wait_for_and_handle_event`).
Once a response (called an _invocation_) is sent to the request made in 
`wait_for_event`, it is _decomposed_ into an _event_, and classified according
to its (detected) invocation type.

If an error occurs during this stage it is handled by
`handle_decomposition_error`. If possible the error will be posted to the error invocation endpoint so that Lambda can process it, but otherwise it will simply
be logged and then the runtime will move onto the next invocation.

The event is passed to `handle_event` which consists of the following steps:

* `parse_event_content` interprets the event content as arguments to be handed
  to the handler function. The user can also provide a function to the
  `deseraliser` argument of `start_listening` (or `start_lambda`), which will
  override the standard parsing logic.
* `generate_result` passes these arguments to the handler function and generates
  a result. If the function accepts a named `context` argument the
  `generate_result` will call on `extract_and_augment_context` to generate the
  invocation context and pass it to the handler function in addition to the
  arguments.
* `serialise_result` converts the result into the response that will be sent to
  Lambda. The user can also provide a function to the `serialiser` argument of
  `start_listening` (or `start_lambda`), which will override the standard
  serialisation logic.
* `post_result` posts the serialised result to the response endpoint.

Afterwards, the runtime will return to the `wait_for_event` function and process
the next invocation that arrives. AWS Lambda may shut down the instance if it
times out before another event invocation arrives.

Alternatively, if an error occurs during `wait_for_event` it will be handled
by `handle_decomposition_error`, or if it occurs during `handle_event` it will
be dispatched to the appropriate `handle_event_error` method according to the S3
class of the event. In either case this will not stop the R session --- an error
when processing a single event is a problem for that event alone. The runtime
will return to the `wait_for_event` step.

All of these functions are diagrammed below, with boxes representing functions
which are grouped together according to the primary function that calls each
of them in sequence. Errors are shown in red.
